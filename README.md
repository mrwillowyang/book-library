2. Easy to reuse existing classes
3. Less custom CSS

## Book metadata

All book metadata including title, author, description and cover image are generated by ChatGPT.

## Data fetching

This application leverages the fetchData function for early data retrieval, initiating the fetch process prior to the start of rendering. On the client side, this function is utilised within an async React component. This async component in React is capable of pausing the rendering of UI components, allowing it to await the completion of the data fetching process. This capability represents a new feature introduced in Next.js 13.

Within it's parent component, the React Suspense is used to prevent the async component from blocking the UI's responsiveness. Instead, it displays a fallback loading component during data fetching. This strategy significantly enhances the UI's loading speed, ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience and improves the First Contentful Paint (FCP) as well as the Time to Interactive (TTI) metric.

## ToDo

- Use a in memory db
- Build a read more button on the book description section
